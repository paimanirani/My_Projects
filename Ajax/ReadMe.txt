In this Project we use AJAX, PHP, and HTML.
It displays a website with a list of pet-stores and its details.
Here, I can edit, retrieve, and add data from my database.

Note- To edit, click on any column of the row you want to make changes, and then click on 'Edit' button.
      To retrieve, select a pet store from drop-down menu.
