In this project an A* search is used to be performed on a 8puzzle.

For input, please pass in an argument
Ex: ./ProblemSolver 0 1 3 4 2 5 7 8 6
If using an IDE, pass in only 0 1 3 4 2 5 7 8 6 (or you can shuffle it)

For output, it will display the sequence on how the board tries to shuffle the numbers to get them in order.
